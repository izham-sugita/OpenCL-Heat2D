This repository shows the simplest way to implement a finite difference method
for solving two-dimensional heat equation using OpenCL. To compile, just run
the source file "compileHeat2D".

$source compileHeat2D

Make adjustment to suit your header files. I have always included the C++
header file cl.hpp in my current directory for convinient sake.

Have fun!
