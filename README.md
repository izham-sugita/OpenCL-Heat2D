This repository shows the simplest way to implement a finite difference method
for solving two-dimensional heat equation using OpenCL. To compile, just run
the source file "compileHeat2D".

$source compileHeat2D

Make adjustment to suit your header files. I have always included the C++
header file cl.hpp in my current directory for convinient sake.

Have fun!

Update!
I added the cl.hpp header from Khronos github. The version that is supported
by NVIDIA GPUs is sadly still 1.2.

Nevermind. Too much upgrade can be a pain.
